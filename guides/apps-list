    1. Zen Browser for look OR Libre Wolf for max sercurity
    2. Transmission (it is default for many distro and did its job)
    3. VSCodium
	  4. LazyVim
    5. Thunar/Nautilus is much preferable (dolphin is not smoothly enough)
    6. Konsole (or any terminal that offers green on black theme with transparent toggle)
    7. Elisa is much better as it can be installed without worrying about aur in arch system
  	8. Clementine (by far the best for my use) UPDATED: VLC (enable multi instance)
    9. Bitwarden
