# create customized commands
1. Using alias
example: alias yt='....'
2. Using bash function
example: yt() {
  yt-dlp -f "bv*[ext=mp4]+ba[ext=m4a]/b[ext=mp4]" --merge-output-format mp4 "$@"
}
After that, source .bashrc before using the commands. Another option is using the script should the process is complex.

# Install tar.gz archive

"To install it, I suggest you to move the folder to /opt/ by running

sudo mv ~/Downloads/RoKiSim/ /opt/

to make the program executable by running

chmod +x /opt/RoKiSim/bin/RoKiSim

and to add a symbolic link to /usr/bin/ by running

sudo ln -s /opt/RoKiSim/bin/RoKiSim /usr/bin/rokisim

After that, you'll be able to run the program just by running rokisim."
