# A list contains problems of linux I encountered

Cisco anyConnect
  Need to update the repository:
  sudo add-apt-repository deb http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy main
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev

Torrent
  1. Stop the torrent
  2. Create new destination
  3. Move the torrent folders/files
  4. Set the location to new location in the torrent client
  5. Force recheck
  6. Check the torrent as it should display a running progress bar
  7. Star the torrent
  
  # The setting location might be tricky so try selecting different folder setup till the bar is green
  # Double check the folder path so you will not get headache

USB Format
  1. lsblk
  # Locate by using this command before and after plugging
  # Or notice the storage amount
  2. sudo wipefs -a /dev/sdX
  # This is faster than dd
  # sda1 for usb stick
  3. sudo fdisk /dev/sdX
      o > n > p > [number] > w
  4. sudo mkfs.ntfs /dev/sdX1
  # Ntfs problem
  5. sudo mkdir /mnt/usb
  6. sudo mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt/usb
  # There is a problem with ntfs whenever plugged to linux system
  # Twice this issue happened
  # Seem to be file system problem
  # DO NOT EJECT OR UNPLUG WITHOUT DOING PROPER UNMOUNT FROM THE FILE EXPLORER

Bluetooth disconnecting in linux
  # Whatever guides online, they just do not work until this:
  # (https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=249637)
  
  1. Get in bluetoothctl
  2. Remove the device based on MAC adddress
  3. Power off
  4. Agent KeyboardDisplay
  5. default-Agent
  6. power on
  7. scan on
  8. trust -> pair -> connect
  
  # Totally failure: Keyboard
  # Only the controller, mouse and headphone are good to go without disconnecting
  
  # For controller, proceed with all the step above
  # Model Gulikit Controller XW
  # Set it to windows mode and connect like usual
  
  # Mouse and headphone is straight forward with bit of tinkling for headphone audio

ISO installation
  1. Download and burn a iso to usb via Rufus if Windows
  # This should be a single boot usb
  # As using multi-boot would later result in errors
  # It works but troublesome later on for some reasons
  # When booting for Thinkpad/Omen
  2. For windows, log in and use advanced startup.
  3. Select usb boot option (can be hidden at the last page)
  4. Proceed with linux installation
  ---------------------------------------
  # As of today, the grub boot load menu still cannot detect Windows
  # Need to go for UEFI menu to boot in Windows if needed

Samsung monitor
  Check which port for PC when plugging the HDMI cable
  Try tinkering with the refresh rate and resolution
  Change the DVD or anything the TV said to PC
  Hope it works by crossing fingers

Game storage
  1. Open steam
  # If moving files to steam folders after opening steam, relauch it
  2. Search the game
  3. Click on downloading the game
  4. The game does not download but check the folders containing the files
  5. Wait for it doing its work
  6. Enjoy

Install tar.gz archive
  Source: https://askubuntu.com/questions/639389/install-tar-gz-but-no-configure-folder-on-install-file
  "To install it, I suggest you to move the folder to /opt/ by running
  
  sudo mv ~/Downloads/RoKiSim/ /opt/                  # to make the program executable by running
  chmod +x /opt/RoKiSim/bin/RoKiSim                   # and to add a symbolic link to /usr/bin/ by running
  sudo ln -s /opt/RoKiSim/bin/RoKiSim /usr/bin/rokisim
  After that, you'll be able to run the program just by running rokisim."

Customized commands
  1. Using alias
  example: alias yt='....'
  2. Using bash function
  example: yt() {
    yt-dlp -f "bv*[ext=mp4]+ba[ext=m4a]/b[ext=mp4]" --merge-output-format mp4 "$@"
  }
  After that, source .bashrc before using the commands. Another option is using the script should the process is complex.

File installation
  1. Move to the tar file to /opt
  2. Make it executable
  chmod +x [file]
  3. Create symbolic link to /usr/bin: sudo ln -s [current file location] [usr/...]
  4. Open terminal and type its name to run the program
  (Source: https://askubuntu.com/questions/639389/install-tar-gz-but-no-configure-folder-on-install-file)
  Nowadays, we can just put the tar file either extract it or drag to the store of your linux distro

CatchyOS with LocalSend Port Disconnection
 1. Due to the port banned, the app can only send but cannot receive
 2. Do:
	sudo ufw allow 53317/tcp
	sudo ufw allow 53317/udp
	sudo ufw reload

KDE Vietnamese Keyboard
 1. sudo pacman -S fcitx5 fcitx5-gtk fcitx5-qt fcitx5-configtool fcitx5-unikey
 2. nano ~/.xprofile
	export GTK_IM_MODULE=fcitx
	export QT_IM_MODULE=fcitx
	export XMODIFIERS=@im=fcitx
 3. Reboot
 4. Open Settings/Virutal Keyboard
 5. Input Method
Further issue with input windows: Constant Vietnamese and changing to it whenever it wants.
So far cannot do anything about this but to remove the unikey keboard until needed.

HP Printer Connection not Found

sudo ufw allow 5353/udp
sudo ufw allow 631/tcp
sudo ufw allow 9100/tcp

sudo ufw disable
lpinfo -v

sudo cupsctl --remote-any --share-printers
sudo systemctl restart cups
However there was no connection even after disabling firewall, need to use direct IP connection.
The IP connection seems to work.
